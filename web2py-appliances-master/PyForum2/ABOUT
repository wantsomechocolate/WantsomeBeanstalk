pyForum app - A web2py pure implementation of a message board (forum) system

I started this project in the begining of March, 2009, as a "learning aid" for
the web2py framework, this application mimics somehow to my other forum appliction
zForum for the Zope world, pyForum, however, has been rewritten and optimized
from scratch in order to provide a complete message board system in pure python.

This software was designed and programmed by Julio Flores Schwarzbeck,
