# Appliances

This is a collection of selected web2py applications (aka appliances) at different stages of completion of quality, written over a period of three years. They are posted here to provide examples of web2py applications for training purposes.

Each folder is a web2py appliance. For example the FacebookClone contains:

    FacebookClone/
       web2py.app.FacebookClone.w2p (the app itself packaged for web2py)
       shot-full.png                (a screenshot)
       shot-thumb.png               (a smaller screenshot)
       ABOUT                        (a description of the app)
       LICENSE                      (if not provided assume BSD)
       models/
       controllers/
       views/
       static/
       languages/
       modules/
       cron/
       uploads/
       tests/
       private/
       ...

They have been tested and they work with the latest/current web2py.

Anybody can contribute to this list by submitting a new appliance as a patch.
