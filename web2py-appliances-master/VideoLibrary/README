VideoTest was developed using Web2Py (www.web2py.com)



To run VideoTest:
	1) Add it to the web2py applications list through the web2py administration panel.
	2)	# cd /path/to/web2py/
			# nohup python web2py.py -S VideoTest -M -R applications/VideoTest/modules/video_to_flv.py
			(the above command executes the daemon process that handles video conversion)



VideoTest utilises the services of:
	ffmpeg			www.ffmpeg.org (for video conversion)
	flvtool2		www.inlet-media.de/flvtool2 (for metadata)
	flowplayer	www.flowplayer.org (for video playback)

VideoTest requirements:
	>	flash plugin for your webbrowser
	>	ffmpeg compiled with support for libmp3lame (you need to have liblame installed prior to making ffmpeg)
	>	flvtool2 (for adding metadata to flvs)
